### What Does **Authoritative** Mean in DNS?

An **authoritative DNS server** is a server that holds the official DNS records for a specific domain. It provides definitive answers to queries about its domain, but it does not perform recursive resolution (i.e., it won’t fetch answers from other DNS servers).

In contrast, a **recursive resolver** is a DNS server that fetches answers from other DNS servers on behalf of a client.
