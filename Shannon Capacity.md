## SNR, the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**
How many levels we can distinguish depends on S/N
- Note noise is random, hence some errors

SNR given on a log-scale in deciBels (dB):
$$SNR_{dB} = 10log_{10}(S/N)$$

# Shannon limit 
...is for capacity (C), the maximum information carrying rate of the channel:
$$C = B\cdot log_2(1 + S/N) bits/sec$$
