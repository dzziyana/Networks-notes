DSL is widely used for broadband; many variants offer 10s of Mbps
- Reuses twisted pair telephone line to the home; it has up to ~2 MHz of bandwidth but uses only the lowest ~4 kHz

DSL uses passband modulation (called OFDM ยง7.4.3)
- Separate bands for upstream and downstream (larger)
- Modulation varies both amplitude and phase (called QAM)
- High SNR, up to 15 bits/symbol, low SNR only 1 bit/symbol
