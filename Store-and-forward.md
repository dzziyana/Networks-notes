involves storing a packet when it is received for processing or sending it at a later point. 

It is mostly used in networks that require mobility, where faulty transmission is common and hence more time is spent on verification if a packet is intact or when an end-to-end communication channel is not available.

# ... Packet Switching
• Routers receive a complete packet, storing it temporarily (if necessary) before forwarding it onwards
• We use **statistical multiplexing** to share link bandwidth over time
