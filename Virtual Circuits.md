Virtual Circuit Model (§1.3.2)
**Three phases:**

1. Connection establishment, circuit is set up
• Path is chosen, circuit information stored in routers

2. Data transfer, circuit is used
• Packets are forwarded along the path

3. Connection teardown, circuit is deleted
• Circuit information is removed from routers

Just like a telephone circuit, but virtual in the sense that no bandwidth need be reserved; statistical sharing of links
